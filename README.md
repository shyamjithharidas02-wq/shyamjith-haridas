## 🚀 Expertise

Passionate about crafting scalable and maintainable mobile applications. I specialize in Flutter development, integrating modern state management solutions and backend services to deliver smooth and efficient user experiences.

With practical experience in Firebase integrations, REST API communication, and real-time features like chat and notifications, I focus on writing clean, structured, and performance-optimized code.

Throughout my development journey, I have:

- Built real-time marketplace applications  
- Integrated secure authentication & payment systems  
- Implemented in-app purchases and multi-language support  
- Designed scalable backend communication structures  
- Worked with Django-based ERP systems and Agora SDK integrations  

I strongly believe in continuous learning, clean architecture, and improving development standards with every project.
